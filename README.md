# Lab 8 - Starter

1. Within a Github action whenever code is pushed. This is because I want to check that my newly pushed code doesn't cause the whole program to crash. I would automate this since I would always want this to run, before the code is pushed.

2. No, end to end tests emulate user actions from start to end but doesn't necessarily check for correct output of specific functions.

3. I would not use a single unit test since there would be multiple functions and things to test. End to end might work better to simulate the feature and its functionality.

4. I would use a unit test to check the maximum message length since it is a simple check. I don't need to run an end to end test to check this functionality.
